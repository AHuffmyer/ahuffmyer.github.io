## About Me

I am a Research Scientist at the University of Washington and an NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow alumna whose research program integrates organismal physiology with molecular and biochemical mechanisms to understand how marine invertebrates respond to environmental stress and how this knowledge can support environmental stewardship. 

Here you'll find information about my research, outreach and education activities, and my comprehensive lab notebook documenting ongoing projects and findings.
