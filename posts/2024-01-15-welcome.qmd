# Overview

This is a sample notebook entry to demonstrate the functionality of the lab notebook system. This entry explains how to create and manage your daily lab notebook entries.

# How to Create New Entries

## Step 1: Copy the Template

1. Navigate to the `posts/` directory
2. Copy the `_template.qmd` file
3. Rename it with a descriptive name (e.g., `2024-01-15-experiment-name.qmd`)

## Step 2: Edit the Metadata

Update the YAML frontmatter at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Entry Title"
author: "Your Name"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
categories: [project-name, keyword1, keyword2]
description: "Brief description"
---
```

### Important Metadata Fields

- **title**: Clear, descriptive title for the entry
- **date**: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format (used for sorting)
- **categories**: List of projects, keywords, and topics (used for filtering)
- **description**: Brief summary (appears in the listing)
- **draft**: Set to `true` to hide the entry from the published site

## Step 3: Write Your Content

Use standard Markdown and Quarto syntax to write your entry. You can include:

- Text and formatting
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Executable code (R, Python, Julia, etc.)
- Figures and images
- Tables
- Mathematical equations
- Interactive plots

### Example: Code Block

````markdown
```{{r}}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# This is an R code example
data <- read.csv("my_data.csv")
summary(data)
```
````

### Example: Python Code

````markdown
```{{python}}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# This is a Python code example
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("my_data.csv")
print(df.describe())
```
````

### Example: Including Images

````markdown
![Figure caption](../images/my_figure.png)
````

# Organizing Your Notebook

## Using Categories Effectively

Categories help you find related entries later. Good category practices:

- **Project names**: Use consistent project identifiers (e.g., "coral-bleaching", "RNA-seq")
- **Keywords**: Add relevant keywords (e.g., "fieldwork", "analysis", "methods")
- **Topics**: Include broader topics (e.g., "molecular-biology", "statistics")

## Search and Filter

The lab notebook page has built-in search and filtering:

- **Search bar**: Search for keywords in titles and content
- **Category filters**: Click category tags to see all related entries
- **Sort options**: Sort by date, title, or other fields

# Best Practices

1. **Write entries promptly**: Record observations while they're fresh
2. **Be detailed**: Include enough detail to reproduce your work
3. **Use consistent naming**: Follow a naming convention for files
4. **Link related entries**: Reference previous entries when relevant
5. **Include metadata**: Always fill out categories and descriptions
6. **Version control**: The notebook is version-controlled with Git

# Next Steps

- [ ] Create your first real notebook entry
- [ ] Set up your project categories
- [ ] Customize the template to fit your needs
- [ ] Add images to the `images/` folder
- [ ] Explore Quarto's features for scientific writing
